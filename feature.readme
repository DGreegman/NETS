# Future Feature Ideas for NETS

Here are some potential features to enhance the NETS scaffolding tool, ordered by potential impact.

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Boilerplate
This is often the most requested feature in scaffolding tools.

*   **What:** Add an option during setup to include pre-built authentication. This would generate the necessary routes (`/register`, `/login`), controllers, and middleware for handling user sign-up and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
*   **Why:** It's a complex and repetitive task that every developer has to build. Providing a secure, ready-to-use template would be a massive time-saver. You could use a library like `Passport.js` to handle the strategies.

### 2. Docker Integration
Containerization is a standard for modern development and deployment.

*   **What:** Automatically generate a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `Dockerfile` would be optimized for a Node.js application (handling dependencies, etc.), and the `docker-compose.yml` could set up the Node app and a database (like Postgres or MongoDB) for easy local development.
*   **Why:** This makes the project instantly portable, simplifies the local development setup (no need to install a database locally), and makes deployment to many platforms trivial.

### 3. Feature Generation (Code Scaffolding)
Evolve NETS from a project scaffolder to a development assistant.

*   **What:** Add a new CLI command, like `nets generate` or `nets add`. Users could run `nets add controller <name>` or `nets add route <name>` to automatically create new, empty files (controller, service, route, model) with the correct boilerplate inside.
*   **Why:** This would keep the project structure consistent and speed up development long after the initial setup is complete. It's a feature developers love in frameworks like Angular, NestJS, and Ruby on Rails.

### 4. API Documentation Generation
Help users create professional, easy-to-use APIs.

*   **What:** Integrate a tool like **Swagger** or **OpenAPI**. You could pre-configure the project with `swagger-jsdoc` and `swagger-ui-express` and even generate a sample route with the necessary comments to show users how it works.
*   **Why:** It provides live, interactive documentation for the API, which is invaluable for frontend developers or other consumers of the API.

### 5. More Tooling and Configuration
Add more options for popular tools.

*   **What:**
    *   **Logging:** Integrate a robust logger like `Winston` or `Pino`.
    *   **Validation:** Add a validation library like `Zod` or `Joi`.
    *   **Email:** Include a basic setup for sending emails with a library like `Nodemailer`.
*   **Why:** These are common requirements for production applications, and providing a pre-configured setup saves developers from having to research and integrate these tools themselves.
